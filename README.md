# ForestEditor
Forest Editor - Editing operations on a single tree

You can edit the forest, including generating multiple trees of the same kind and the corresponding undo/redo operations. You can copy and delete individual trees, and modify the shape, size, and angle of the trees.

The method is similar to the tree editor. First, the trees are formed by a tree branch, and then multiple trees are added to the forest container. All the generated forests can be traversed in the forests container, which is also the key to realize the undo/redo operation. .
